###  ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜„ Hi, I'm Tom,


I Spent the last decade Managing and building Events From Theatre to Festivals,<br/> 
now I spend my time managing google searches and building full stack stuff.<br/>

Please take the time to look around, nose in my [repos](https://github.com/Plume93?tab=repositories) (we both know its what you want to see) and generally decide if what ive been up to is any good :).

ðŸ’¬ Please if you thinks its good or bad (especially s@Â£#), let me know! 

Either on :

or

Jokes aside there are a few humble projects on here, none of which are completed (at time of writing 14/7/22) but soon will be, so watch this space for some big baller stuff!

ðŸ¤” I'm Currently working on: 
- My Portfolio Site [Fire From The Booth](https://github.com/Plume93/fire-from-the-booth) (Not Deployed) that I [designed myself](https://www.figma.com/file/zIBuCztelBzlQ9rHRsEil9/fire-from-the-booth) and am building in React.
- An API Based react app called [Make Your Mon](https://github.com/Plume93/make-your-mon) (Not Deployed) that will enable you to make your own Pokemon.

âš¡ Fun fact: I'm published in 3 Books. Hit me up if you find any!
